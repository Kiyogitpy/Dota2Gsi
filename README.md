# Dota 2 Timer and Roshan Overlay

This project provides a simple Dota 2 timer and Roshan overlay for your desktop, offering a convenient way to keep track of in-game time and events. The overlay includes a countdown timer for Roshan's respawn, and the timer plays audio alerts for different in-game events.

## Features

- In-game timer that tracks the current Dota 2 game time
- Roshan respawn countdown overlay with color-coding: red for the first 1/3, yellow for the second 1/3, and green for the last 3 minutes.
- Plays an audio alert when Roshan respawns
- Provides audible alerts for stacking camps, express runes, and a third customizable sound alert.
- Hotkey support: Press 'F21' to start/reset the Roshan timer, 'Page Down' to stop the script (an audio alert plays on termination), 'F22' to send the current Roshan time to chat, and 'Page Up' to mute the sounds.
