# Dota2Gsi
 
A dota 2 tool to make a countdown for rosh using f22 button and using the inbuilt dota2 GSI recieve game data and track timed events such as stacking/lotus/exp rune

You will also need to create a custom gamestate_integration_*.cfg in game/dota/cfg/gamestate_integration/, for example:
gamestate_integration_test.cfg:

as i havent added that to the script.

pageup mutes sounds, pagedown terminates the script.
you only need to run main.py for it to work :)
